Project: Vehicle Management System
File: vehicle_registration.py
Description:
This module handles the registration of new vehicles in the system, including validation of vehicle details and owner information.
Classes and Methods:
class VehicleRegistration:
    """
    Handles the registration of vehicles.


    Attributes:
        vehicle_id (str): Unique identifier for the vehicle.
        owner_id (str): Unique identifier for the owner of the vehicle.
    """


    def __init__(self, vehicle_id, owner_id):
        """
        Initialize a new VehicleRegistration instance.
        
        Parameters:
            vehicle_id (str): The unique identifier for the vehicle.
            owner_id (str): The unique identifier for the owner.
        """
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id

    def validate_details(self):
        """
        Validate the details of the vehicle and owner.


        Returns:

    def register_vehicle(self):
        """
        Register the vehicle with validated details.


        Returns:
            dict: Registration status and vehicle details.
